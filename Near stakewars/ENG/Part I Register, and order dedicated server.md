We will show you on the example of [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/))

#### Server Requirements
1. Choosing a server
Please see the hardware requirement below:

| Hardware       | Chunk-Only Producer  Specifications                                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------       |
| CPU            | 4-Core CPU with AVX support                                           |
| RAM            | 8GB DDR4                                                              |
| Storage        | 500GB SSD                                                             |
